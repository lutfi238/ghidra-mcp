## v5.6.0 - 2026-04-25 (release regression + fun-doc workflow)

Release covering deploy/regression safety, live benchmark coverage, debugger
endpoint validation, and a substantial fun-doc workflow upgrade: per-worker
config freezing, quota-aware provider pause/resume, a continuously-running
background inventory scorer, and verb-tier function-name quality
enforcement at the rename layer.

### Added

#### Deploy / regression / debugger

- **Live deploy release regression** — deploy can opt into benchmark-backed
  read/write, multi-program, negative-contract, and debugger-live regression
  tiers via `--test ...` or local `GHIDRA_MCP_DEPLOY_TESTS`.
- **Benchmark debugger fixture** — `fun-doc/benchmark` now builds
  `BenchmarkDebug.exe` alongside `Benchmark.dll` so debugger MCP endpoints
  can be exercised against a real launched process.
- **Scoped prompt policy endpoint** — `/prompt_policy` temporarily handles a
  narrow allow-list of known Ghidra automation dialogs during
  deploy/regression runs while leaving normal interactive prompts
  untouched.

#### fun-doc workflow

- **Worker config snapshot** — workers freeze the dashboard's policy fields
  (`good_enough_score`, `audit_provider`, `audit_min_delta`,
  `complexity_handoff_provider`, `complexity_handoff_max`, per-provider
  `provider_max_turns` + `provider_models`) at start and read from the
  snapshot for the rest of their life. Mid-run live-config edits no longer
  affect a running worker — restart-to-change semantics. Snapshot is
  persisted to `events.jsonl` via a `worker.started` event so post-hoc log
  analysis can join run records to the exact config under which they ran.
  Dashboard shows a per-worker config sub-line and fires a toast when
  saving the queue config diverges from any running worker's snapshot.
- **Provider model + max-turns defaults backfill** — `priority_queue.json`
  now backfills missing per-provider entries from a module-level
  `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_MODELS` (gemini, claude, codex, minimax). Fresh
  installs and partial configs get fully populated dashboard inputs
  without manual setup.
- **Background inventory scorer** — opt-in daemon that fills missing
  `analyze_function_completeness` scores across every binary in the Ghidra
  project tree. Idle-time backfill (yields when any doc worker is active),
  most-missing-first ordering with reverse-alpha tiebreak, single-thread,
  cooperative pause at chunk boundaries, session blacklist after 3
  strikes, dedicated `fun-doc/inventory.json` persistence. Dashboard
  widget plus an Inventory panel with sortable per-binary table (coverage
  bar, scored, total, missing, %, status, last scan).
- **Quota-aware provider pause/resume** — when a provider returns a quota-
  wall error (gemini's "exhausted your capacity", claude's "credit balance
  is too low", codex's "insufficient_quota", minimax's quota messages),
  fun-doc parses the reset duration, installs a per-(provider, model)
  pause in `fun-doc/provider_pauses.json`, and parks every worker on that
  model until the timer fires. Soft rate limits (<5 min) stay in retry
  logic; hard walls (≥5 min) install a pause. Dashboard surfaces a
  `quota_paused` worker state with a live wake-time countdown. Manual
  override via `POST /api/provider_pauses/clear`.
- **Function-block visual** — per-function worker output is wrapped in a
  three-sided gold bracket (top + left + bottom, open right). Header is
  the function's start name; footer is the post-rescore name (so renames
  are visible). Body indented; blank lines stripped within a block; one
  blank line of breathing room between blocks. Worker abandon mid-function
  emits a synthetic `(interrupted)` footer so headers never go orphaned.
- **Three-column worker grid** — dashboard now shows 3 worker panes per
  row instead of 2, fitting ~50% more workers without scrolling.

#### Naming-quality enforcement

- **Verb-tier function-name quality** — `NamingConventions` gains Tier 1 /
  Tier 2 / Tier 3 verb classification, a weak-noun denylist, PascalCase
  tokenization, and a `checkFunctionNameQuality` API returning structured
  rejection (`vague_verb`, `weak_noun_only`, `missing_specifier`). Tier 3
  verbs (`Process`, `Handle`, `Manage`, …) require ≥2 specifier tokens
  after the verb; weak nouns (`Data`, `Info`, `Stuff`, …) don't count as
  specifiers.
- **Token-subset duplicate detection** —
  `NamingConventions.findTokenSubsetCollision` flags function-name
  collisions where one name's tokens are a strict subset of another's
  within the same module-prefix scope (e.g., `SendStateUpdate` ⊂
  `SendStateUpdateCommand`).
- **Three new completeness deductions** — `low_name_quality` (-8),
  `name_collision` (-10), `missing_module_prefix` (-5; fires when name has
  no `UPPERCASE_` prefix and ≥3 callees share one). Surfaces existing bad
  legacy names in the work queue with point pressure to fix them.

#### New endpoints

- `GET /api/inventory/status`, `POST /api/inventory/toggle`,
  `POST /api/inventory/clear_blacklist` — background scorer surface.
- `GET /api/provider_pauses`, `POST /api/provider_pauses/clear` —
  quota-pause surface.

### Changed

- **Deploy lifecycle** — deploy now saves all open programs, attempts
  graceful Ghidra exit, force-kills matching leftovers when needed,
  installs the extension, starts Ghidra, waits for MCP/project readiness,
  and runs schema smoke checks.
- **Benchmark project reset** — benchmark tiers reset `/testing/benchmark`
  in the active project, import both benchmark binaries, auto-analyze
  them, and clear restored benchmark tool state before startup.
- **`rename_function_by_address` validator gate** — hard-rejects names
  failing the verb-tier rules or token-subset uniqueness with a structured
  error: `{"status": "rejected", "error": …, "issue": …,
  "rejected_name": …, "conflicts_with": …, "message": …, "suggestion": …}`.
  Function is unchanged on rejection; the model retries with a better
  name. Auto-generated names are exempt. `step-prototype.md` documents the
  verb tiers, weak-noun list, a worked-example pass/fail table, and a
  rejection round-trip guide.
- **Complexity-handoff fall-through** — when handoff can't fire (no
  provider configured, cap reached, or target walled), the worker now
  continues with primary instead of skipping the function. Removes a
  silent `consecutive_fails` increment on healthy functions for
  config/transient reasons.
- **Worker title color treatment** — provider/id token in the worker pane
  header is now white (`text-primary`); the active function name is gold
  (`accent-gold`) so the eye lands on what you're tracking.
- **Audit / handoff under quota wall** — when the target provider+model is
  walled, audits log `audit_outcome: quota_paused` and skip; handoffs
  pre-empt and stick with primary. No `consecutive_fails` bump.

### Fixed

- **`list_functions_enhanced` thunk parity** — `isThunk` now uses the same
  `AnalysisService.classifyFunction` path as
  `analyze_function_completeness`, so single-jump thunk heuristics agree
  across both tools. Thanks to PR #165 by c8rri3r.
- **`create_struct` tool guidance** — MCP schema/catalog descriptions now
  spell out the expected `fields` JSON array format, optional decimal
  `offset`, accepted alternate field keys, and valid type sources so agents
  stop trying C-like struct strings or CSV bodies.
- **Gemini quota errors silently swallowed** — `_invoke_gemini`'s retry-
  exhaust path now propagates `provider_error` / `provider_error_type`
  into the run record so the dashboard and `runs.jsonl` show the actual
  message ("exhausted your capacity, quota will reset after Xh") instead
  of `output: null` / `error: null`.
- **State lock reentrancy** — `_state_lock` switched from `Lock` to
  `RLock` so `load_state` can be called from within a `with _state_lock:`
  block without deadlocking.

### Tests

- 28 offline tests for the inventory scorer (ordering, blacklist,
  pause-gate, scored definition, JSON shape stability).
- 34 offline tests for the provider-pause module (parser, per-provider
  detectors, threshold, manager round-trip, callback semantics).
- 13 offline tests for the worker config snapshot (shape, freeze
  guarantees, fall-through, conditional banner).
- 31 offline tests for `NamingConventions` (tokenize, verb tiers,
  specifier counting, all rejection codes, token-subset collision in
  both directions, module-prefix scoping, exact-match exemption).
- Updated `test_provider_selection.py` to cover the new
  `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_MODELS` backfill behavior.

## v5.5.0 - 2026-04-23 (maintenance)

Maintenance release focused on cleanup and release readiness after the
v5.4.1 security hardening work.

### Fixed

- **`FunctionService` decompiler lifetime handling** — closes owned
  `DecompInterface` instances on all relevant success, early-return, and
  exception paths to avoid leaking decompiler subprocesses during
  decompilation and variable-update workflows.
- **Claude/CAPI tool-name compatibility in the Python bridge** —
  `bridge_mcp_ghidra.py` now enforces the stricter `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`
  constraint when sanitizing and collision-suffixing tool names, matching
  client expectations instead of emitting overlong names.
- **Bundled Ghidra script resource ownership** — script-side
  `DecompInterface` usage now follows scoped `try/finally` disposal in the
  affected batch, export, survey, and audit helpers.
- **Claude subprocess lifetime in bundled scripts** — the Claude-invoking
  scripts now drain and close readers with try-with-resources and use
  bounded `waitFor(timeout, TimeUnit.SECONDS)` handling with terminate/kill
  fallback instead of unbounded waits.

- **fun-doc logging diagnostics** - provider watchdog workers now inherit
  per-run debug context, early exits are recorded in `runs.jsonl`, Ghidra
  HTTP failures write structured diagnostics, and debug analyzers count
  normalized provider error statuses.

### Docs

- **Release metadata refreshed to `5.5.0`** across Maven, plugin/headless
  fallbacks, manifest metadata, endpoint catalog, operator docs, and the
  release index.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — added a concise resource-ownership checklist for
  services and bundled scripts, covering disposable helpers,
  transactions, child-process lifecycle, and timeout expectations.

## v5.4.1 - 2026-04-18 (security)

Security + operational-readiness release on top of v5.4.0. Addresses the
findings from a full production-readiness audit: unauthenticated HTTP
surface, ungated RCE-class endpoints, silent `--bind 0.0.0.0`, broken CI
after the debugger merge, stale metadata, and an empty v5.4.0 release
page.

### Breaking change

- **`/run_script_inline` and `/run_ghidra_script` are now off by default.**
  These endpoints execute arbitrary Java against the running Ghidra
  process. Set `GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOW_SCRIPTS=1` (or `true`/`yes`) to restore
  v5.4.0 behavior. Error message surfaced to callers names the env var
  and explains why.

### Security — opt-in hardening (default = pre-v5.4.1 localhost behavior)

New [`com.xebyte.core.SecurityConfig`](src/main/java/com/xebyte/core/SecurityConfig.java)
— read-once, thread-safe snapshot of three env vars:

- **`GHIDRA_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`** — when set, every HTTP request must carry
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Constant-time byte comparison resists
  timing attacks. `/mcp/health`, `/health`, `/check_connection` are
  always-exempt read-only pings. Enforced in the GUI plugin's
  `safeHandler()` wrapper and the new headless
  `safeContext(path, handler)` registration helper (replaces bare
  `server.createContext` at all 32 sites).
- **`GHIDRA_MCP_ALLOW_SCRIPTS`** — see Breaking change above.
- **`GHIDRA_MCP_FILE_ROOT`** — when set, filesystem-path endpoints
  canonicalize input and require it to fall under the configured root.
  Mechanism + helper (`SecurityConfig.resolveWithinFileRoot()`) shipped
  in this release; per-endpoint wiring for `/import_file`,
  `/delete_file`, `/open_project`, etc. follows in v5.4.2.

### Security — bind hardening

- Headless `startServer()` now calls
  `SecurityConfig.requireAuthForNonLoopbackBind(bindAddress)` before
  binding. Non-loopback binds (`0.0.0.0`, explicit external IP) now
  refuse to start unless `GHIDRA_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is configured. Error
  message names the env var.

### CI

- **All four workflows now install the three Ghidra Debugger JARs**
  (`Debugger-api`, `Framework-TraceModeling`, `Debugger-rmi-trace`) —
  every build on main since the v5.4.0 debugger merge had been failing
  because these weren't in the `mvn install:install-file` blocks.
  Release workflow re-ran successfully after the fix; v5.4.0 release
  page now has attached artifacts (was empty at tag time).
- **Offline Java tests run in CI.** The 11 annotation-scanner + catalog
  parity tests (~3 s) were previously only run on developer machines;
  they now gate every push/PR on `main` and `develop`. Integration
  tests (which require live Ghidra on port 8089) remain excluded.

### Fixed

- **Python debugger startup + target query flow on Windows** — the
  debugger backend now validates `WINDBG_DIR` before importing `pybag`,
  falls back to a Microsoft Store WinDbg cache when the Windows Kits
  debugger directory is incomplete, stops double-waiting after
  `AttachProcess`, parses `pybag` module tuples correctly, and reads
  x64 register sets (`RAX`-`R15`/`RIP`) instead of returning empty
  register output on 64-bit targets.
- **WOW64 register context** — when attached to 32-bit processes under
  WOW64, debugger register reads now switch dbgeng's effective
  processor to x86 so the API returns `EAX`/`ECX`/`ESP`/`EIP` instead of
  the host-side 64-bit `R*` context. The same x86 view is used for
  stack-context reads that depend on those registers.

### Docs

- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — v5.4.0 entry backfilled (was missing at tag
  time). This v5.4.1 entry.
- **`README.md`** — version badge `5.3.2 → 5.4.0 → 5.4.1`, tool-count
  references refreshed to 219 (5+ occurrences), new `## 🔒 Security`
  section documenting the three env vars with a worked LAN-exposure
  example and a migration note for the script-gate breaking change,
  Dynamic Analysis features subsection covering emulation + debugger,
  GUI/headless endpoint counts corrected.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — version + tool count, Architecture section updated
  for `EmulationService`, `DebuggerService`, `debugger/` Python
  package on port 8099 via `GHIDRA_DEBUGGER_URL`, and
  `HeadlessManagementService`.
- **`tests/endpoints.json`** — `version` field `5.2.0 → 5.4.1` (had
  been stale since v5.3).
- **`src/main/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`** — `Plugin-Version`
  `4.4.0 → 5.4.1` (very stale).
- **`src/main/resources/extension.properties`** — tool count
  `199 → 219`; dynamic-analysis capabilities noted.
- **`GhidraMCPHeadlessServer.java`** — `VERSION` string
  `5.3.2-headless → 5.4.1-headless`.

### Hygiene

- **Deprecated-API warning suppressed** in
  `HeadlessEndpointHandler.batchSetComments` — Ghidra 12's deprecated
  `Listing.setComment(Address, int, String)` + `CodeUnit` int
  constants. Silences the "Some input files use or override a
  deprecated API" warning that appeared on every clean build.
- **`requirements.txt:8`** — bumped `requests` floor to `>=2.32.0`
  per CVE-2024-35195 (certificate-verification bypass).
- **`.playwright-mcp/`** added to `.gitignore` — Playwright MCP
  scratch directory was appearing in `git status` after every browser
  test.
- **Per-function escalation + audit tracking (fun-doc)** — when a
  worker auto-escalates mid-function to a stronger provider, or when
  the post-function audit pass runs, the function record is now
  stamped with `escalation_count` / `last_escalated` /
  `last_escalation_from` / `last_escalation_to` /  `audit_count` /
  `last_audited` / `last_audit_provider` / `last_audit_delta`.
  `/api/stats` surfaces two new counters (`audited`, `escalated`).

### Known gaps (follow-ups to v5.4.2)

- **Per-endpoint file-path root check.** The `SecurityConfig`
  mechanism is ready, but individual endpoints (`/import_file`,
  `/delete_file`, `/open_project`, `/load_program`, etc.) still
  accept raw paths. Wire-up in next patch.
- **Debugger endpoints are still live-untested.** 17 Java + 22 Python
  bridge tools compile, pass offline tests, and fail gracefully when
  no debug session is attached, but haven't been exercised against a
  running target. v5.4.2 or v5.5.0 will ship with live-validation
  logs.
- **Three placeholder endpoints** (`/detect_crypto_constants`,
  `/find_dead_code`, `auto_decrypt_strings`) still in the schema with
  "Not yet implemented" responses.

## v5.4.0 - 2026-04-18

Feature release. Three new service domains land together: P-code emulation,
live debugger integration, and PCode-graph data flow analysis. Plus headless
catalog fixes, fun-doc UI improvements, and a `--use-venv` setup flag. Tool
count rises from 199 → 219 on main.

### Added

- **P-code emulation** (#127) — [`EmulationService.java`](src/main/java/com/xebyte/core/EmulationService.java)
  exposes two new endpoints backed by Ghidra's `EmulatorHelper`:
  - `POST /emulate_function` — run a function with user-supplied register
    and memory state; returns the final register values. Memory regions
    accept base64 (`data`), hex, or `string` forms, wrapped under
    `{"regions": [...]}` in the JSON body.
  - `POST /emulate_hash_batch` — brute-force API hash resolution. Iterates
    a candidate list, writes each string into scratch memory, runs the
    hash function, and compares the result register against a target hash.
    Returns all matches (collision-safe) plus a `best_match` convenience
    field.

  Live-verified against D2Common.dll: a two-instruction leaf
  (`MOV EAX, [ECX+4]; RET`) round-trips `0xDEADC0DE` through the emulator,
  and `/emulate_hash_batch` correctly isolates a single matching
  candidate from a three-item list using a contrived hash target.

- **Live debugger integration** (#128) — two-part addition:
  - Java side: [`DebuggerService.java`](src/main/java/com/xebyte/core/DebuggerService.java)
    exposes 17 `/debugger/*` endpoints (`status`, `traces`, `resume`,
    `interrupt`, `step_{into,over,out}`, `{set,remove,list}_breakpoint`,
    `registers`, `read_memory`, `stack_trace`, `modules`,
    `{static,dynamic}_to_{dynamic,static}`, `launch_offers`) wrapping
    Ghidra's `DebuggerTraceManagerService`,
    `DebuggerLogicalBreakpointService`, and `TraceRmiLauncherService`.
    Supports whatever backend Ghidra's TraceRmi framework provides
    (`dbgeng` for Windows PE targets, `gdb`/`lldb` otherwise). GUI-only —
    not wired into the headless server because `DebuggerService` requires
    a `PluginTool`.
  - Python side: new [`debugger/`](debugger/) package with a standalone
    HTTP server on port 8099 (engine, protocol, tracing, address_map,
    D2-specific convention parser). `bridge_mcp_ghidra.py` registers 22
    static MCP tools (`debugger_attach`, `debugger_continue`,
    `debugger_step_*`, `debugger_registers`, `debugger_read_memory`,
    `debugger_stack_trace`, `debugger_trace_*`, `debugger_watch_*`) that
    proxy to the server via the `GHIDRA_DEBUGGER_URL` env var.

  Compile + offline tests pass for both layers. Live-session testing is
  pending an attached debug target.

- **Data flow analysis** (#125, closes #111) — `GET /analyze_dataflow`
  traces value propagation through a function using the decompiler's
  PCode graph. Backward mode walks producers via `Varnode.getDef()`;
  forward mode walks consumers via `Varnode.getDescendants()`.
  Terminates at constants, function inputs, call boundaries, or
  `max_steps`. Phi (`MULTIEQUAL`) nodes are summarized as single steps
  rather than recursed. Anchor resolution accepts register names
  (`EAX`), HighVariable names (`param_1`, `local_14`), or empty for the
  first PcodeOp output at the address. Live-verified against
  `ANIM_GetFrameData` in D2Common.dll: the backward chain reproduces the
  decompiler output `*(byte *)(pUnit->dwField50 + 0x10 + nAnimIndex)`
  step-for-step.

- **Headless program/project management** (#121, #122, #123) — the eight
  headless-specific endpoints (`/load_program`, `/close_program`,
  `/create_project`, `/open_project`, `/close_project`,
  `/load_program_from_project`, `/get_project_info`, `/server/status`)
  were previously registered manually and invisible to `/mcp/schema`,
  so `list_tool_groups` omitted them. New
  [`HeadlessManagementService.java`](src/main/java/com/xebyte/headless/HeadlessManagementService.java)
  moves them into the annotation scanner. Parity test extended to
  scan the headless-only service so catalog drift in these endpoints
  now fails at `mvn test` time.

- **`--use-venv` flag for Linux setup** (#120) — the legacy Linux setup flow
  can now install Python deps into a local `.venv` instead of the
  system Python, required on Ubuntu 24.04+ where system Python is
  externally-managed.

### Changed

- **`tests/endpoints.json`** regenerated via `RegenerateEndpointsJson`
  — 199 → 219 entries. The `version` field, stale at `5.2.0`, is bumped
  to `5.4.0`. Categories list adds `emulation` and `headless`.
- **fun-doc UI** (#126) — layer filter dropdown (matches dashboard BFS
  computation), 7 sortable column headers replacing the previous
  dropdown sort, `Layer` column replacing `Callers`, 500-row table cap
  removed, `Focus` button on worker panes + banner wired to
  `/api/navigate`, `Stop All Workers` button with visibility logic,
  runs-today counter reads the full log file, auto-escalate to stronger
  provider when score < `good_enough`. Live smoke-tested via Playwright
  against the running dashboard.
- **`tests/endpoints.json` catalog corrections** (#123) — three headless
  endpoint params had been miscatalogued (`/load_program`: `path` →
  `file`; `/close_program`: `program` → `name`;
  `/load_program_from_project`: two params → one). Catalog is now
  authoritative and validated by the offline parity test.

### Fixed

- **Intermediate varnode rendering in `/analyze_dataflow`** (second
  commit on #125) — Ghidra's `HighVariable` returns the literal string
  `"UNNAMED"` for anonymous intermediates. The initial implementation
  rendered these as `"UNNAMED"` instead of falling through to the
  `unique:<id>` labeling. Fixed by skipping the placeholder and
  surfacing the unique varnode id, giving traceable dependency chains.

### Security

- No security-relevant changes in v5.4.0. The unchanged default state
  — unauthenticated HTTP endpoints with the option to bind `0.0.0.0`
  in headless mode — applies here as before. **A v5.4.1 security
  release is planned** to address auth, bind hardening, script-endpoint
  gating, and path canonicalization on file-handling endpoints.

### Known gaps

- **Debugger endpoints are live-untested.** All 17 Java endpoints and
  22 Python bridge tools compile, pass offline annotation-parity tests,
  and fail gracefully when no debug session is attached, but they have
  not been exercised against a running target. v5.4.1 or v5.5.0 will
  ship with live-validation logs.
- **Three placeholder endpoints** remain in the schema with "Not yet
  implemented" responses: `/detect_crypto_constants`, `/find_dead_code`,
  `auto_decrypt_strings`. These will either be implemented or switched
  to returning an error in a subsequent release.

---

## v5.3.2 - 2026-04-15 (hotfix)

Second hotfix on the v5.3.x line, shipped after a multi-hour overnight
test session exposed three bugs that v5.3.1 didn't catch. Each was
reproducible and live-verified fixed. No new features, no breaking
changes. Semver PATCH bump.

### fun-doc

#### Fixed

- **Pass 2 (`FULL:comments`) never ran for codex or claude** — [fun_doc.py:3960](fun-doc/fun_doc.py#L3960)
  gated the two-pass flow on `tool_calls_made > 0`. Both providers use
  `_wrap_result` which sets `tool_calls: -1` ("unknown, trust run") since
  neither the codex nor the claude SDKs report per-turn tool counts.
  `-1 > 0` was False, so Pass 2 was skipped on every codex/claude run.
  Pass 2 is the phase that adds plate comments and EOL markers, which is
  typically what pushes a function from ~55-65% to 80%+. Without it,
  both providers plateaued and re-entered the selector forever.
  Changed the gate to `!= 0`.

  Live verification (2026-04-15 14:18–14:23, 5 runs across both providers):
  ```
  InitializeVideoState            codex   59→100  (+41)  FULL:comments  completed
  ResetNpcMenuState               claude  59→100  (+41)  FULL:comments  completed
  CreateMissileCheckingSkillFlags codex   61→100  (+39)  FULL:comments  completed
  InitializeExpansionAudio        claude  61→ 92  (+31)  FULL:comments  completed
  ReinitializeExpansionAudio      codex   61→ 91  (+30)  FULL:comments  completed
  ```
  Average delta: **+36.4%** vs. yesterday's +13-25%. Five for five reached
  the `good_enough_score` (80) on the first attempt.

- **Infinite re-pick loops on no-progress runs** — Selector had no
  mechanism to blacklist a function that keeps completing with zero
  progress. Observed pattern on 2026-04-15:
  ```
  RenderResourceBarProgress       codex  ×46 runs, all +0%
  CLIENT_UpdateUnitDisplayEffects codex  ×68 + claude ×18, all +0%
  IsPathTargetMonsterBoss         codex  ×24 runs, 23 at +0% then +10
  UpdateRoomLevelTracker          claude ×28 runs, pattern [+0,-7,+7,+0×25]
  CheckNetworkSessionTimeout      claude ×27 runs, pattern [-8,+8,+0×25]
  CLIENT_UpdateUnitDisplayEffects claude ×18 runs, all +0%
  ```
  Guard #2 (no-progress downgrade) requires `tool_calls_made == 0`, so
  `-1` from codex/claude never triggered it. `consecutive_fails` only
  tracks hard failures, not stagnant completions. `partial_runs >= 3`
  only deprioritizes 10× — still pickable when nothing else is available.
  `recovery_pass_done` only fires for `complexity_tier == "massive"`.

  Fix: new `stagnation_runs` counter in [fun_doc.py:4256](fun-doc/fun_doc.py#L4256),
  incremented on `(completed|partial) and delta <= 1` (covers +0%, +1%,
  and all regressions). Reset on `delta >= 5`. Selector excludes funcs
  with `stagnation_runs >= 3` unless pinned. Cleared by `scan --refresh`,
  `refresh_candidate_scores` (dashboard "Refresh Top N"), or pinning.

- **Claude false `BLOCKED:` false-positive from ToolSearch confusion** —
  The `_invoke_claude` system prompt at [fun_doc.py:3105](fun-doc/fun_doc.py#L3105)
  instructed the agent to "Use ToolSearch to load the ghidra-mcp MCP
  tools if they are not yet available". But `ToolSearch` is for *deferred*
  tools (ones listed in `<system-reminder>` but not loaded). ghidra-mcp
  tools are statically registered via `~/.claude.json` → `mcpServers.ghidra`
  and are **immediately callable** under `mcp__ghidra-mcp__<name>`. They
  never appear as deferred.

  Following the old prompt, claude would burn 5-12 turns trying
  `ToolSearch` with various queries, get empty results each time, then
  declare "BLOCKED: the required MCP tools are not available in this
  runtime". Observed 11 false-positive `BLOCKED:` results out of 213
  claude runs (≈5%) on 2026-04-15. Score deltas on those runs were
  typically 0% or negative (because a rename had landed but the follow-up
  type/prototype work gave up).

  Fix: new system-prompt append tells claude the tools are already
  registered and to call them directly by the short or fully-qualified
  name, and explicitly says *do not* use ToolSearch for ghidra-mcp tools.
  Prevents the whole class of false-BLOCKED outcomes.

### Test coverage

- **3 new selector invariant tests** for `stagnation_runs`:
  - `test_stagnation_runs_excluded_at_threshold` (checks `== 3` and `> 3`)
  - `test_stagnation_runs_bypassed_by_pin`
  - `test_stagnation_runs_does_not_affect_unflagged` (0, 1, 2, missing)
- **Total offline test count**: 27 Python + 25 Java (was 24 + 25 in v5.3.1)

### Why this release exists

The v5.3.1 release was shipped in the afternoon with confidence that it
covered all the observed issues. It didn't. The codex Pass-2 bug was
live during v5.3.1 and triggered the multi-hour loops on codex workers
that same evening. v5.3.2 is the real "stable multi-provider workloads
finish successfully" release.

**Provider parity**: before v5.3.2, only minimax could reliably reach
`good_enough_score` on `use_two_pass`-eligible functions because only
minimax reported tool counts truthfully. After v5.3.2, all three
providers (minimax, codex, claude) reach good_enough_score on the first
attempt for the same class of function. Live-measured average score
delta parity: minimax ≈ +20%, codex ≈ +36%, claude ≈ +36% in the post-fix
session.

## v5.3.1 - 2026-04-14 (hotfix)

Stability and observability hotfix on top of v5.3.0. Ships after a multi-hour live test session that uncovered several issues the v5.3.0 release didn't fully address. All three AI providers (minimax, codex, claude) verified under concurrent 6-worker load; zero failures across 63 runs in the final test session.

### Ghidra Plugin

#### Fixed

- **`decompileFunctionNoRetry` cap lowered to 12 s** (was 60 s) — `FunctionService` now uses `NO_RETRY_DECOMPILE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 12` on all scoring/analysis code paths. Math: composite handlers like `/analyze_for_documentation` chain up to 4 sequential decompiles (primary → nested `analyze_function_completeness` → `validateParameterTypeQuality` fallback), so 4 × 12 = 48 s worst case, comfortably under the 60 s client HTTP timeout and well below Ghidra's 20 s Swing-deadlock threshold per individual call. Pathological functions exceeding 12 s are treated as "too complex to score" and blacklisted via the new fun-doc one-shot flag — an acceptable trade since they would otherwise pin the HTTP thread pool.

- **Four more MCP handler call sites routed through `decompileFunctionNoRetry`** — v5.3.0 only wired one path (`batch_analyze_completeness`). Remaining retry-wrapped callers discovered and fixed:
  - `AnalysisService.analyzeFunctionComplete` at line 2058
  - `AnalysisService.validateParameterTypeQuality` fallback at line 3607 (reachable from `analyze_function_completeness` when the primary decompile fails)
  - `AnalysisService.analyzeForDocumentation` primary decompile at line 3953
  - `DocumentationHashService.getFunctionDocumentation` at line 359

  Under v5.3.0 these paths still escalated 60 → 120 → 180 s per call. A single pathological function could pin an HTTP thread for up to 6 minutes and leak `DecompInterface` contexts on abandoned retries. Live test confirmed: zero `Decompilation attempt` log lines and zero `UnableToSwingException: Timed-out waiting for Swing thread lock` errors across a 125-minute 6-worker session with 35,653 completed tasks.

### fun-doc

#### Fixed

- **Opus empty-output parser trust** — When opus runs on massive-complexity functions it sometimes burns its entire output-token budget on `tool_use` blocks and never emits a trailing text block with a `DONE:` marker. The work is committed to Ghidra, but fun-doc's parser saw the empty `output` string, hit the `else: result = "failed"` branch at [fun_doc.py:3827](fun-doc/fun_doc.py#L3827), and re-queued the function — paying the cost twice. Observed ~$15/function of wasted opus invocations before the fix. Parser now treats `empty output + tool_calls_made >= 5` as `completed` and lets Guard #2b (score regression check) catch genuine no-ops.

- **Recovery-pass one-shot flag (`recovery_pass_done`)** — Massive-complexity functions receive exactly one complexity-forced recovery pass; the flag is set on completion and the selector excludes flagged functions from future picks until an explicit refresh clears it. Stops the "re-queue forever below `good_enough_score`" loop. Cleared by `scan --refresh`, dashboard's `Refresh Top N`, or manual pinning.

- **Decompile-timeout one-shot flag (`decompile_timeout`)** — Complement to the Java 12 s cap. When a decompile-heavy Ghidra endpoint hits a read timeout, `fetch_function_data` sets `func.decompile_timeout = True` and the selector skips it. Turns three `consecutive_fails` cycles (~180 s wasted per pathological function) into one 60 s miss. Implemented via a new `threading.local` tracker inside `ghidra_get`/`ghidra_post` that flags `ReadTimeout` specifically.

- **Bridge empty-string schema-default filter** — Codex's MCP client passes schema default values (including empty strings) to every tool call. Ghidra handlers treat empty strings as "missing" and fail on required params. Bridge now filters `v is None or v == ""` from kwargs. Matches minimax's direct-HTTP behavior. Bundled as hygiene; not the primary cause of codex failures (see codex config fix below).

- **ContextVar debug logging** — Replaced `threading.local()` with `contextvars.ContextVar[dict]` in the debug module. Defensive refactor: `ContextVar` propagates correctly across `asyncio` tasks, generators, and `asyncio.to_thread` executor boundaries where `threading.local` can silently break. Offline E2E test verifies cross-context propagation.

- **Claude `ToolResultBlock` capture** — `_invoke_claude`'s message-handler loop only iterated `AssistantMessage.content` blocks. Per `claude_agent_sdk._internal.message_parser`, `ToolResultBlock` arrives in `UserMessage.content` (the Anthropic API convention is "user sends tool results back"). The existing `ToolResultBlock` handler inside `AssistantMessage` was dead code, so `_debug_log_tool_call()` was never reached on the claude path. Refactored to iterate both `AssistantMessage` and `UserMessage` content blocks; TextBlock capture stays gated on AssistantMessage (UserMessage text is the outgoing prompt). Live-verified with a real claude session: 2 tool calls captured end-to-end with correct correlation and JSONL output.

- **Dashboard worker pane reconnect** — On page refresh the local `workerPanes` map starts empty. The `worker_status` event fires on reconnect with the server-authoritative list but the old handler did `if (!pane) return` — updating existing panes only. Result: running workers reappeared with title `? #abcde` instead of `codex #abcde`. Fix: `worker_status` now calls `getOrCreatePane(w.id, w.provider, w.binary)` for unknown workers and refreshes the title on existing panes.

### Codex configuration

- **`~/.codex/config.toml` tool approval list** — Not a code change, but critical for codex to work with the Ghidra MCP at all. The user's codex config had `approval_mode = "approve"` for only 37 tools; the other 162 Ghidra MCP tools defaulted to `ask` which in headless/SDK mode = reject. This caused a silent 35% failure rate on codex runs (observed: all 7 `get_function_callers` failures in one session). Session fix added entries for the remaining tools. Future installs should either populate the full approval list or use a newer codex SDK with wildcard approval.

### Test coverage

- **6 new selector invariant tests** in `tests/performance/test_selector_invariants.py`:
  - `test_recovery_pass_done_excluded_when_not_pinned`
  - `test_recovery_pass_done_bypassed_by_pin`
  - `test_recovery_pass_done_does_not_affect_unflagged_functions`
  - `test_decompile_timeout_excluded_when_not_pinned`
  - `test_decompile_timeout_bypassed_by_pin`
  - `test_decompile_timeout_does_not_affect_unflagged`

- **24 Python + 25 Java offline tests** all green on every commit in this release.

## v5.3.0 - 2026-04-14

### Ghidra Plugin

#### Added

- **`/mcp/health` endpoint** — Returns HTTP server pool stats, uptime, memory, and active request count. Used by the fun-doc dashboard and by regression tests to observe server saturation.
- **HTTP thread pool (pool size = 3)** — `GhidraMCPPlugin` now uses a fixed thread pool for HTTP request handling instead of the default single-threaded executor. Size 3 is a deliberate compromise: large enough that a slow write doesn't block every read, small enough to avoid saturating Ghidra's Event Dispatch Thread (sizes ≥ 8 triggered `Swing.runNow` deadlocks via `ToolTaskManager.taskCompleted`).
- **Annotation scanner offline test suite** — `src/test/java/com/xebyte/offline/` adds 11 pure-reflection tests that run without Ghidra: schema generation shape, path uniqueness, HTTP method validity, `tests/endpoints.json` parity (scanner ⊆ catalog), param parity, and `total_endpoints` consistency. Partial implementation of #112.
- **`RegenerateEndpointsJson` utility** — Opt-in test (`mvn test -Dtest=RegenerateEndpointsJson -Dregenerate=true`) that rewrites `tests/endpoints.json` from the annotation scanner, preserving hand-authored descriptions and hand-registered routes like `/mcp/health` and `/check_connection`.

#### Fixed

- **`AnalysisService.batch_analyze_completeness` partial-results bug** — When one function's decompile timed out, the batch threw and discarded every successful result in the same request. Now inserts an error marker for the failed function and continues the loop. `PER_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_SEC` raised to 90 s to give the 60 s internal decompile cap a 30 s buffer.
- **`FunctionService.decompileFunctionNoRetry`** — New single-attempt decompile helper used by the scoring path. The retry-wrapped `decompileFunction` escalated 60 → 120 → 180 s and leaked `DecompInterface` contexts when the scoring timeout fired mid-retry, eventually OOMing the JVM.
- **`tests/endpoints.json` drift** — The annotation scanner catalog parity test found and fixed 5 missing endpoints (`/analysis_status`, `/import_file`, `/reanalyze`, `/set_image_base`, `/set_variables`), 10 HTTP method mismatches, ~50 missing `@Param` entries, and a missing `/mcp/health` row. `total_endpoints`: 193 → 199.

### fun-doc

#### Added

- **Priority queue system** — Replaces the old pin-one-at-a-time model. `priority_queue.json` stores a FIFO work queue. Auto-dequeues functions when they hit `good_enough_score` (configurable per-binary, default 80). Dashboard surfaces the queue with scan progress, handoff counter, and stale-skip counter.
- **Complexity handoff** — Workers can hand a function to a more capable provider when the current model's completeness plateaus. Default cascade: minimax → claude (disabled by default, set `complexity_handoff_max`).
- **Debug mode** — Per-function JSONL tool-call logs under `fun-doc/debug/<function_key>.jsonl`. Captures every MCP call, its truncated args, and result. Ship with `fun-doc/analyze_debug.py` CLI for post-hoc pattern analysis (consecutive same-tool runs, failed retries, repeated args).
- **Atomic state writes** — `_atomic_write_state()` uses temp + fsync + `os.replace` + `.bak` rotation. Fixes the lost-update race where multiple workers saving whole-state from their in-memory copies clobbered each other's per-function updates.
- **`update_function_state(key, func)`** — Per-function atomic read-modify-write under `_state_lock`. Replaces every per-function `save_state(state)` call in the processing path.
- **Pagination-aware function list fetch** — `_fetch_function_list` now pages through `list_functions_enhanced` in 10k chunks. Previously silently truncated binaries above 10,000 functions (`glide3x.dll`, `libcrypto-1_1.dll`).
- **Regression test suite** under `tests/performance/` — 30 tests across selector invariants, state atomicity, HTTP concurrency contract, listing consistency, batch scoring consistency, and `/mcp/health` shape. Most skip gracefully without a live Ghidra server; `test_selector_invariants.py` and `test_state_atomicity.py` run fully offline.

#### Fixed

- **fun-doc run/debug log provenance** — `runs.jsonl` now records `run_id`, requested vs effective provider, provider chain, `tool_calls_known`, prompt size, token metadata, and the concrete debug log path. Debug traces are now one file per run attempt instead of co-mingling multiple providers in a single per-function file, and tool names are normalized across Gemini/Claude/Codex/MiniMax while preserving the raw provider-specific name.
- **fun-doc dashboard + handoff analysis follow-up** — provider cards now compute average tool counts from known samples only, explicitly count unknown tool-call runs, surface handoff/provider-chain summaries, ship a dedicated `fun-doc/analyze_runs.py` CLI for requested→effective provider analysis, and move the live complexity handoff target from Codex to Gemini.
- **Cold-start lane infinite re-processing loop** — `_sync_func_state` didn't stamp `last_processed`, so the selector kept re-picking already-scored functions. Worst seen: SafeDelete stuck at 83% across hundreds of iterations.
- **"Stale at X%" misleading message** — The cached score was captured after `_sync_func_state` had already overwritten it, so the log always showed the live value. Captures `original_cached_score` before sync now.
- **`RETRY_SIZE` vs client timeout math** — Retry batch was 10 × 90 s = 900 s > 600 s client budget. Reduced to `RETRY_SIZE = 3` (270 s, fits with 330 s margin).
- **`tests/conftest.py` IPv6 fallback** — Default base URL changed from `http://localhost:8089` to `http://127.0.0.1:8089`. Windows dual-stack `localhost` resolution tries IPv6 first, times out after exactly 2 s, then falls back to IPv4 — adding ~2000 ms to every test request.

### Docs

- `CLAUDE.md` Testing section now documents offline vs. integration test commands and the `RegenerateEndpointsJson` escape hatch.
- Tool count updated: 193 → 199 (README, CLAUDE.md, endpoints.json).

---

## v5.2.0 - 2026-04-11

### Ghidra Plugin

#### Added

- **Request serialization in MCP bridge** — Added `threading.Lock` around all Ghidra HTTP calls in `bridge_mcp_ghidra.py` to prevent JSON-RPC stdout corruption when multiple MCP tool calls arrive concurrently (#91).
- **Dry-run mode for mutating endpoints** — Pass `dry_run=true` query parameter to any POST endpoint to preview changes without committing to the Ghidra database. Implemented via nested transaction rollback in `AnnotationScanner` — no service code changes needed. All dynamic MCP tools for POST endpoints now include an optional `dry_run` parameter (#110).
- **Composable completeness scoring** — Added `include_completeness` flag to `analyze_function_complete` endpoint. When enabled, includes full completeness scoring in the same response, eliminating the need for a separate `analyze_function_completeness` call (#109).

---

## v5.1.0 - 2026-04-10

### fun-doc: Multi-Provider Dashboard & Worker System

The fun-doc automation engine was substantially rebuilt. It now ships a real-time web dashboard, supports parallel workers across multiple AI providers, and includes quality guards that catch common AI documentation mistakes.

#### Added

- **Real-time WebSocket dashboard** — `python fun_doc.py` (no args) launches a web UI with live activity feed, progress charts, and control panel. EventBus architecture pushes updates via WebSocket.
- **Multi-provider worker system** — Run up to 4 parallel workers across Claude, Codex, and MiniMax providers simultaneously. Per-worker output panes in a 2×2 grid.
- **Continuous mode** — Workers fetch and document functions one-at-a-time in a continuous loop.
- **MiniMax AI provider** — Added MiniMax-M2.7 as a low-cost first-pass documentation option with dedicated hardening: Hungarian notation audit (Guard #4), complexity gating, `<think>` tag stripping, partial tracking, dynamic max_tokens, reasoning preservation.
- **Codex provider** — Added OpenAI Codex (gpt-5.3-codex) to the provider dropdown.
- **Quality guards** — Evidence-based documentation workflow with Guards #1–5, score-delta validation, and variable reconciliation in step-verify prompt.
- **Classification-aware prompting** — `_inject_classification_directives()` automatically limits wrapper/stub functions (≤10 code lines) to minimal plate comments (Summary, Parameters, Returns, Source only), preventing over-documentation with struct layouts and disassembly comments.
- **Phantom variable hints** — Functions with phantom variables (`in_EAX`, `in_EDX`, `extraout_*`) get a pre-prompt directive to attempt `set_function_prototype` before documenting.
- **Guard #5: magic number EOL reconciliation** — Catches models that document magic numbers in the plate comment but skip EOL comments at instruction addresses. Downgrades to partial for requeue when ≥2 undocumented magic numbers remain in non-wrapper functions.
- **Source section enforcement** — Guard #3 now validates plate comment structural completeness (missing Source line, etc.) using the scorer's `plate_issues` field. Step-comments and fix-plate-comment prompts explicitly mark Summary, Source, Parameters, and Returns as required sections.
- **Verify checklist expansion** — Step-verify prompt adds name-vs-behavior contradiction detection (rename if name contradicts actual code behavior) and magic number EOL coverage verification.
- **Folder & binary selector** — Dashboard discovers all project binaries from Ghidra, supports per-binary scan with persistent state filtering.
- **Cross-binary progress view** — Phase 3 folder switcher shows documentation progress across all binaries in a project.
- **ROI queue** — Dashboard control panel with ROI-prioritized function queue and deduction breakdown.
- **Claude agent-sdk migration** — Migrated from deprecated `claude-code-sdk` to `claude-agent-sdk`.

#### Fixed

- **Score-delta guard** — No longer falsely triggered for Claude when `tool_calls=-1`; relaxed to accept +0% when tools made changes.
- **State file race condition** — Fixed concurrent write corruption of `state.json` during parallel worker operation.
- **Page size limit** — All Functions table capped at 200 entries to prevent 24 MB pages.
- **Per-binary scan stats** — Rescan now scores unscored functions and no longer reports other binaries as removed.
- **Batch scoring** — Falls back to individual scoring when batch endpoint fails; increased timeout and added progress reporting.

### Ghidra Plugin

#### Added

- **Streamable HTTP transport** — `--transport streamable-http` is now documented and recommended for web/HTTP clients. SSE transport is deprecated. Added `ghidra-mcp-http` config example to `mcp-config.json`.
- **Engineering backlog** — Added `docs/project-management/BACKLOG.md` with prioritized roadmap from competitive fork analysis (GitHub issues #109–#114).
- **Gradle build** — Added Gradle-based Ghidra extension build as an alternative to Maven (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`).

#### Fixed

- **read_memory OOM** (#107) — Capped `read_memory` allocation at 16 MB to prevent out-of-memory on malicious/large length values.
- **SSRF in connect_instance** (#106) — Wired `validate_server_url()` into `connect_instance` and `_auto_connect` TCP paths.
- **urlparse import** (#113) — `validate_server_url()` used `urlparse` but it was only imported inside `tcp_request()`. The bare `except` silently swallowed the `NameError`, causing all connections to fail. Moved import to module scope.
- **LoadResults.save() signature** — Corrected to match Ghidra 12.0.3 API (takes `TaskMonitor` only). Fixes Docker build and compilation errors (#103, #104).
- **Program param standardization** — All `@Param("program")` annotations now use `QUERY` source consistently. Fixes batch operations that failed when `program` was sent in POST body.
- **import_file "Database is closed"** — Fixed race condition in program import flow.
- **Batch rename variables** — Fixed `programName` not passed through in fallback paths.
- **batch_analyze_completeness** — Now passes program param to per-function calls correctly.

---

## v5.0.0 - 2026-04-03

GhidraMCP v5.0 marks a deliberate shift: from a passive Ghidra mirror to an **active enforcement layer**. Tools that write annotations now enforce naming conventions, reject no-ops, and auto-correct struct fields. At the scale of thousands of functions, multiple binary versions, and parallel AI + human workflows, conventions can't be suggestions — they must be in the tool.

This is a contract change. If you have scripts or prompts built against earlier versions, review the breaking changes below.

### Breaking Changes

| Tool / Behavior | Before | After (v5.0) |
|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| `batch_rename_variables` | endpoint name | **Renamed** to `rename_variables` — update all callers |
| `add_struct_field` | `insertAtOffset` (shifts subsequent fields) | `replaceAtOffset` — same call, different field layout |
| `set_local_variable_type` | accepted undefined→undefined silently | **Rejected with error** — type must actually change |
| Struct field names | passed through as-is | **Auto-prefixed** with Hungarian notation based on data type |

### Completeness Scoring Redesign
- **Log-scaled budget system**: Every per-count deduction category now has a fixed point budget with log-scaled penalties. No single category can dominate the score. Monster functions (5,000+ variables) no longer score 0%.
- **Tiered plate comment scoring**: Missing plate (-35pts), stub (-25pts), incomplete (-15pts), minor (-8pts), complete (0pts). Rewards quality, not just presence.
- **Effective score only counts fixable deductions**: Structural (unfixable) deductions are fully forgiven. Functions with only structural deductions score 100% effective.
- **Bulk stack-array heuristic**: Functions with 100+ undefined variables reclassify the excess as structural (impractical to fix via API).
- **Address-suffix name detection**: Functions ending with hex address suffixes (e.g., `_6FD93C30`) flagged as 20pt fixable deduction.
- **`__thiscall` ECX auto-param**: Correctly classified as structural/unfixable. `set_function_prototype` warns when `__thiscall` `this` type can't be changed.

### Naming Convention Enforcement
- **NamingConventions.java**: Centralized validation utility -- PascalCase function names, Hungarian variable prefixes, `g_` global prefixes, snake_case labels, plate comment structure.
- **Auto-fix struct field prefixes**: `create_struct`, `add_struct_field`, `modify_struct_field` automatically apply correct Hungarian prefixes based on field type.
- **Function name validation**: Warns on non-PascalCase, missing verb, too short. Module prefixes (`UPPERCASE_`) accepted and validated separately.
- **`set_local_variable_type` rejects undefined-to-undefined**: No-op type changes rejected with helpful error.

### New Tools
- **`/set_variables`**: Atomic type + rename in a single transaction. Sets types first, decompiles, then renames with Hungarian validation. Eliminates SSA churn.
- **`/check_tools`**: Verify if specific tools are callable. Returns `callable`, `not_loaded`, or `not_found` with fix suggestions.
- **`/rename_variables`**: Renamed from `/batch_rename_variables` for conciseness.

### Tool Improvements
- **`batch_set_comments`**: `decompiler_comments` and `disassembly_comments` arrays now optional (default `[]`). Omitting `plate_comment` leaves existing plate untouched.
- **`add_struct_field`**: Uses `replaceAtOffset` instead of `insertAtOffset` -- overlays undefined bytes without shifting subsequent fields. Off-by-one at struct boundary fixed.
- **`modify_struct_field`**: Accepts `offset:N` syntax (e.g., `offset:16` or `offset:0x10`) for unnamed fields.
- **`create_struct`**: Accepts flexible JSON key names (`field_name`, `fieldName`, `data_type`, etc.).
- **`get_function_variables`**: `limit` and `filter` params now optional with defaults.
- **`get_current_function` / `get_current_address`**: Now discovers CodeBrowser instances via ToolManager (was broken in FrontEnd mode). Returns JSON with program path.

### Plate Comment Validation
- **Summary line check**: First non-empty line must be >20 chars.
- **Parameter count cross-validation**: Compares Parameters section entries against function signature.
- **Returns/return-type match**: Catches void function with non-void docs and vice versa.
- **Source file reference**: Checks for `Source:` line.
- **Algorithm step substance**: Flags steps with <10 chars of content.
- **Parameter entry quality**: Flags entries lacking type + description.

### fun-doc Automation Engine
- **Codex SDK integration**: `AI_PROVIDER = "codex"` routes to OpenAI Codex Python SDK with MCP tools. Claude Code SDK also integrated.
- **Select mode (`-s`)**: Fetches current function from CodeBrowser, builds prompt. `--depth 2` recursively collects callers/callees.
- **Manual mode (`-m -s`)**: Single-keypress flow -- copies prompt, press any key for next function, `q` to quit.
- **State sync**: Pre-work and post-work sync points update `state.json` with live completeness data.
- **Short-circuit**: Functions at 95%+ with 0 fixable deductions auto-skip in auto mode (not manual).
- **Smart mode routing**: >= 100% VERIFY, >= 70% FIX, < 70% FULL. No smart promotion.

### Prompt V6 Improvements
- **Score removed from prompts**: Prevents models from coasting on high scores.
- **Consistency checklist**: Step 5 requires function name vs plate comment alignment check.
- **Module prefix decision**: 2-signal gate (Source file, behavior domain, callee family) before applying prefix.
- **Naming confidence rules**: Require evidence for semantic names. Placeholders (`dwUnknown1D0`) for unproven fields.
- **Struct creation gate**: Reuse-first, 3+ validated fields, 2+ code paths required. Otherwise comment-only.
- **Verification removed**: `analyze_function_completeness` no longer called inside prompts. Scoring handled externally.
- **Known module prefixes**: `prefixes.json` injected into every prompt.
- **Opportunistic checks in FIX mode**: Function name, prototype, plate comment, variable names.
- **`batch_set_comments` schema documented**: Exact JSON format in step-comments.md.
- **Non-ASCII sanitized**: All em dashes and arrows replaced with ASCII equivalents.

### Bridge Improvements
- **All tools loaded at startup** (`--lazy` default changed to False): Fixes Claude Code/Codex not seeing dynamically loaded tools.
- **`load_tool_group` returns tool names**: Response includes exact list of newly loaded tools.
- **TCP fallback in `list_instances()`**: Windows environments now show the active TCP connection (PR #90).
- **Program param optional on all tools**: Schema fixes from PR #92 -- omitting `program` uses active program.
- **Xref tools accept address directly**: `get_function_callers`/`get_function_callees` no longer require name-only lookup.

### Bug Fixes
- **`effective_score > max_achievable_score`**: Fixed -- effective score capped at max achievable.
- **`analyze_for_documentation` pre-fetch**: Was using `address` instead of `function_address` param. Fixed.
- **CodeBrowser detection**: `get_current_function`/`get_current_address` now search running CodeBrowser instances via ToolManager.
- **Callers/callees plain text parsing**: `fun_doc.py` now handles both JSON and text response formats from xref endpoints.

## v4.3.0 - 2026-03-09

### Annotation-Based Endpoints & Dynamic Bridge Registration

#### `@McpTool`/`@Param` Annotation Infrastructure
- All ~144 service methods across 12 service classes annotated with `@McpTool` and `@Param`
- `AnnotationScanner` discovers annotated methods via reflection and generates `EndpointDef` records
- `/mcp/schema` endpoint returns JSON schema describing all tools, parameters, types, and categories
- New endpoints are now a single step: annotate the service method and it's automatically discoverable

#### Dynamic Bridge Tool Registration
- Bridge fetches `/mcp/schema` from Ghidra HTTP server at startup and auto-registers ~170 MCP tools
- Reduced bridge from ~8,600 lines to ~2,400 lines (72% reduction)
- 22 complex tools with bridge-side logic (retries, local I/O, multi-call, Knowledge DB) remain as static `@mcp.tool()` functions
- `STATIC_TOOL_NAMES` set controls which tools skip dynamic registration
- `_make_tool_handler()` creates handlers with proper `inspect.Signature` for FastMCP introspection
- GET endpoints route all params as query string via `safe_get_json`
- POST endpoints separate query vs body params based on schema source field
- Graceful fallback: if Ghidra is not running, logs warning and starts with only static tools

#### Test Suite Updates
- Rewrote `test_mcp_tool_functions.py` for dynamic registration architecture
- Tests cover: schema type mapping, default conversion, handler creation, parameter routing, static tool availability
- Updated endpoint count assertions for static-only decorator count (15-50 range)

### Bug Fixes & Compatibility

- **Fixed POST endpoint data format** (#66): `safe_post()` was sending form-urlencoded data while the Java server expected JSON. Changed to send `json=data` instead of `data=data`, fixing `rename_function_by_address` and all other POST-based endpoints.
- **Added segment:offset address support** (#65): Bridge now accepts segment-prefixed addresses (e.g., `mem:20de`, `code:00169d`) used by non-x86/segmented architectures. Updated `sanitize_address()`, `validate_hex_address()`, and `normalize_address()` to pass through segment-qualified addresses without incorrect `0x` prefixing.
- **Relaxed Ghidra version compatibility check** (#64): The legacy setup flow now warns instead of error when deploying to a Ghidra installation with a different patch version (e.g., building with 12.0.3 and deploying to 12.0.4). Major.minor mismatches still block deployment.
- **Fixed Linux phantom process detection** (#63): Tightened the legacy Linux setup process detection regex to match only the Java class name pattern (`ghidra.GhidraRun`/`ghidra.GhidraLauncher`), removing overly broad alternatives that caused false positives.
- **Fixed FrontEndProgramProvider multi-version bugs**: Fixed consumer reference leak on cache overwrite, `pathToName` not cleared in `releaseAll()`, and `getAllOpenPrograms()` deduplicating by name instead of identity (hiding same-named programs from different versions).
- **Reduced MCP response token usage ~30-40%**: Optimized JSON response payloads across service endpoints.

## v4.2.1 - 2026-03-06

### Documentation Completeness Improvements

#### `analyze_function_completeness` Enhancements
- Added **context-aware scoring** for compiler/runtime helper functions (e.g., CRT/SEH helpers) to reduce false penalties.
- Added **fixable vs structural deductions** in response payload:
  - `fixable_deductions`
  - `structural_deductions`
  - `max_achievable_score`
  - `deduction_breakdown` (verbose mode)
- Added **structured remediation output** (`remediation_actions`) with per-issue tool mapping, evidence samples, and estimated score gain.
- Added function context flags:
  - `is_stub`
  - `is_compiler_helper`
  - `documentation_profile`
- Improved plate comment validation with a **compact helper profile** (5-line minimum, Purpose/Origin + Parameters) for compiler/helper functions.
- Updated workflow recommendations to be **classification-aware** (compact helper workflow vs full workflow).

---
## v4.2.0 - 2026-03-02

### Knowledge Database Integration + BSim + Bug Fixes

#### Knowledge Database (5 new MCP tools)
- **`store_function_knowledge`** -- Store documented function data (name, prototype, comments, score) to PostgreSQL knowledge DB with fire-and-forget semantics
- **`query_knowledge_context`** -- Keyword search across documented functions using PostgreSQL `ILIKE`/`tsvector` full-text search. Returns relevant prior documentation to inform new function analysis
- **`store_ordinal_mapping`** -- Store ordinal-to-name mappings per binary version (e.g., D2Common.dll ordinal 10375 = GetUnitPosition)
- **`get_ordinal_mapping`** -- Look up known ordinal names by binary, version, and ordinal number
- **`export_system_knowledge`** -- Generate markdown export of documented functions grouped by game system, suitable for book chapters and content creation
- **Graceful degradation**: All knowledge tools return `{"available": false}` when DB is unreachable. Circuit breaker disables DB after 3 consecutive failures for the session. RE loop proceeds without knowledge DB.
- **Connection pool**: `psycopg2.ThreadedConnectionPool` with configurable DB host/port/credentials via `.env` file
- **Schema**: 3 new tables (`ordinal_mappings`, `documented_functions`, `propagation_log`) with full-text search indexes and `updated_at` triggers

#### BSim Cross-Version Matching (4 new Ghidra scripts)
- **`BSimIngestProgram.java`** -- Ingest all functions from current program into BSim PostgreSQL DB. One-time per binary version.
- **`BSimQueryAndPropagate.java`** -- Query BSim for cross-version matches of a specific function, returns JSON sorted by similarity score
- **`BSimBulkQuery.java`** -- Bulk query all undocumented (FUN_*) functions against BSim DB for batch propagation
- **`BSimTestConnection.java`** -- Verify BSim PostgreSQL connectivity and return DB metadata
- **3-tier matching cascade** in RE loop: exact opcode hash (fastest) -> BSim LSH similarity (medium) -> fuzzy instruction pattern (slowest)

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fix #44**: Enum value parsing -- Gson parses JSON integers as `Double` (0 -> 0.0), causing `Long.parseLong("0.0")` to fail silently. Replaced hand-rolled parser with `JsonHelper.parseJson()` + `Number.longValue()`. Hex strings (`0x1F`) now also accepted.
- **Improved error messages**: Enum creation with empty/invalid values now returns descriptive errors instead of silent failures

#### Dead Code Cleanup
- Removed ~243KB of deprecated workflow modules superseded by the RE loop skill
- Deleted deprecated slash commands (`auto-document.md`, `improve-cycle.md`, `fix-issues.md`, `improve.md`)

#### Migration Scripts
- **`scripts/apply_schema.py`** -- Apply knowledge DB schema to PostgreSQL (idempotent, handles "already exists" gracefully)
- **`scripts/migrate_learnings.py`** -- One-time migration from flat files (learnings.md, loop_state.json, community_names.json) to knowledge DB tables

#### Counts
- 193 MCP tools, 175 GUI endpoints, 183 headless endpoints

---

## v4.1.0 - 2026-03-01

### Parallel Multi-Binary Support

#### Universal `program` Parameter
- **Every program-scoped MCP tool now accepts an optional `program` parameter** -- Pass `program="D2Client.dll"` to any tool to target a specific open program without calling `switch_program` first
- **Eliminates race conditions** -- Parallel requests targeting different programs no longer contend on shared `currentProgram` state
- **Backward compatible** -- Omitting `program` falls back to the current/default program, preserving existing workflows
- **Full stack coverage**: Bridge helpers (5), 136 MCP tools, 130+ GUI endpoints, 130+ headless endpoints, and all 9 service classes updated

#### Service Layer Changes
- All service methods now accept `String programName` and resolve via `getProgramOrError(programName)`
- Backward-compatible overloads (`method(args)` delegates to `method(args, null)`) preserve internal callers
- Services updated: FunctionService, CommentService, DataTypeService, SymbolLabelService, XrefCallGraphService, DocumentationHashService, AnalysisService, MalwareSecurityService, ProgramScriptService

#### Bridge Changes
- `safe_get`, `safe_get_json`, `safe_post`, `safe_post_json`, `make_request` all accept `program=` kwarg
- GET helpers inject `program` into query params; POST helpers append `?program=X` to URL
- `switch_program` docstring updated: now documented as setting the default fallback, with explicit `program=` recommended for parallel workflows

#### Counts
- 188 MCP tools, 169 GUI endpoints, 173 headless endpoints

---

## v4.0.0 - 2026-02-28

### Major Release -- Service Layer Architecture Refactor

#### Architecture Refactor
- **Monolith decomposition**: Extracted shared business logic from `GhidraMCPPlugin.java` (16,945 lines) into 12 focused service classes under `com.xebyte.core/`
- **Plugin reduced 69%**: `GhidraMCPPlugin.java` went from 16,945 to 5,273 lines (server lifecycle, HTTP wiring, and GUI-only endpoints remain)
- **Headless reduced 67%**: `HeadlessEndpointHandler.java` went from 6,452 to 2,153 lines by delegating to the same shared services
- **Zero breaking changes**: All HTTP endpoint paths, parameter names, and JSON response formats are unchanged. The MCP bridge and all clients work without modification

#### New Service Classes
- `ServiceUtils` -- shared static utilities (escapeJson, paginateList, resolveDataType, convertNumber)
- `ListingService` -- listing/enumeration endpoints (list_methods, list_functions, list_classes, etc.)
- `FunctionService` -- decompilation, rename, prototype, variable management, batch operations
- `CommentService` -- decompiler/disassembly/plate comments
- `SymbolLabelService` -- labels, data rename, globals, external locations
- `XrefCallGraphService` -- cross-references, call graphs
- `DataTypeService` -- struct/enum/union CRUD, validation, field analysis
- `AnalysisService` -- completeness analysis, control flow, similarity, analyzers
- `DocumentationHashService` -- function hashing, cross-binary documentation
- `MalwareSecurityService` -- anti-analysis detection, IOCs, malware behaviors
- `ProgramScriptService` -- program management, scripts, memory, bookmarks, metadata

#### New Feature
- **Auto-analyze on open_program**: `open_program` endpoint now accepts optional `auto_analyze=true` parameter to trigger Ghidra's auto-analysis after opening a program (inspired by PR #42 from @heeen)

#### Counts
- 184 MCP tools, 169 GUI endpoints, 173 headless endpoints

#### Design Decisions
- Instance-based services with constructor injection (`ProgramProvider` + `ThreadingStrategy`)
- GUI mode uses `GuiProgramProvider` + `SwingThreadingStrategy`; headless uses `HeadlessProgramProvider` + `DirectThreadingStrategy`
- Services return JSON strings (same as before); `Response` sealed interface deferred to v5.0
- Existing `createContext()` endpoint registration pattern preserved (grep-friendly, proven)

---

## v3.2.0 - 2026-02-27

### Bug Fixes + Version Management

#### Bug Fixes (Cherry-picked from PR #38)
- **Fixed trailing slash in DEFAULT_GHIDRA_SERVER** -- `urljoin` path resolution was broken when the base URL ended with `/`
- **Fixed fuzzy match JSON parsing** -- `find_similar_functions_fuzzy` and `bulk_fuzzy_match` now use `safe_get_json` instead of `safe_get`, which was splitting JSON responses on newlines and destroying structure
- **Fixed OSGi class cache collisions for inline scripts** -- Inline scripts now use unique class names (`Mcp_<hex>`) per invocation instead of the fixed `_mcp_inline_` prefix, which caused the OSGi bundle resolver to cache stale classloaders

#### Bug Fixes
- **Fixed multi-window port collision (#35)** -- Opening a second CodeBrowser window no longer crashes with "Address already in use". The HTTP server is now a static singleton shared across all plugin instances, with reference counting for clean shutdown

#### Completeness Checker Improvements
- **New `batch_analyze_completeness` endpoint** -- Analyze multiple functions in a single call, avoiding per-function HTTP overhead. Accepts JSON array of addresses, returns all scores at once
- **Thunk comment density fix** -- Thunk stubs are no longer penalized for low inline comment density (thunks are single JMP instructions with no code to comment)
- **Thunk comment density recommendations** -- `generateWorkflowRecommendations` no longer suggests adding inline comments to thunk functions
- **Ordinal_ auto-generated name detection** -- `isAutoGeneratedName()` helper now covers FUN_, Ordinal_, thunk_FUN_, thunk_Ordinal_ prefixes across all checker endpoints
- **Callee-based ordinal detection** -- `undocumented_ordinals` now uses `func.getCalledFunctions()` instead of text scanning, eliminating false positives from self-references and caller mentions in plate comments
- **Thunk variable skip** -- Thunks with no local variables skip all body-projected decompiler artifacts
- **Relaxed thunk plate comment validation** -- Thunks only need to identify as forwarding stubs, not include full Algorithm/Parameters/Returns sections

#### Infrastructure
- **Fixed ENDPOINT_COUNT** -- Corrected from 146 to 149 to match actual `createContext` registration count
- **Centralized version in extension.properties** -- Description now uses `${project.version}` Maven filtering instead of hardcoded version string
- **Expanded version bump workflow** -- Now covers 11 files (up from 7): added README badge, AGENTS.md, docs/releases/README.md. Extension.properties is now Maven-dynamic.
- **Version consistency audit** -- Fixed stale 3.0.0 references across setup/config files, tests/endpoints.json, README.md, AGENTS.md, and docs/releases/README.md

---

## v3.1.0 - 2026-02-26

### Feature Release -- Server Control Menu + Completeness Checker Fixes

#### New Features
- **Tools > GhidraMCP server control menu** -- Start/stop/restart the HTTP server from Ghidra's Tools menu with status indicator
- **Deployment automation** -- TCD auto-activation patches tool config for plugin auto-enable; AutoOpen launches project on Ghidra startup; ServerPassword auto-fills server auth dialog
- **Batch workflow improvements** -- Strengthened dispatch prompt with explicit storage type resolution instructions; added practical note for p-prefix pointer pattern

#### Bug Fixes
- **Completeness checker: register-only SSA variables** -- Variables with `unique:` storage that can't be renamed/retyped via Ghidra API are now tracked as unfixable, boosting `effective_score` accordingly
- **Completeness checker: ordinal PRE_COMMENT detection** -- Ordinals documented via `set_decompiler_comment` appear on the line above the code in decompiled output; checker now checks previous line for PRE_COMMENT
- **Completeness checker: Hungarian notation types** -- Added `dword`/`uint` (dw), `word`/`ushort` (w), `qword`/`ulonglong` (qw), `BOOL` (f) to expected prefix mappings
- **CI Help.jar fix** -- Added Help.jar dependency to all CI workflow configurations (build.yml, release.yml, tests.yml)
- **Dropped Python 3.8/3.9** -- CI matrix now targets Python 3.10+ only

---

## v2.0.0 - 2026-02-03

### Major Release - Security, Ghidra 12.0.2, Enhanced Documentation

#### Ã°Å¸â€â€™ Security
- **Localhost binding**: HTTP server now binds to `127.0.0.1` instead of `0.0.0.0` in both GUI plugin and headless server Ã¢â‚¬â€ prevents accidental network exposure on shared networks

- Successfully propagated `ConcatenatePathAndWriteFile` documentation across versions
- Identical functions produce matching hashes despite different base addresses

#### Ã°Å¸â€ºÂ  Tool Count
- **Total MCP Tools**: 118 (112 implemented + 6 ROADMAP v2.0)
- **New tools added**: 7 (4 Java endpoints + 3 Python index management tools)

## v1.8.4 - 2025-10-26

### Bug Fixes & Improvements - Read-Only Tools Testing

**Critical Fixes:**
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Fixed silent failures in `get_xrefs_to` and `get_xrefs_from`**
  - Previously returned empty output when no xrefs found
  - Now returns descriptive message: "No references found to/from address: 0x..."
  - Affects: Java plugin endpoints (lines 3120-3167)

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Completed `get_assembly_context` implementation**
  - Replaced placeholder response with actual assembly instruction retrieval
  - Returns context_before/context_after arrays with surrounding instructions
  - Adds mnemonic field and pattern detection (data_access, comparison, arithmetic, etc.)
  - Affects: Java plugin getAssemblyContext() method (lines 7223-7293)

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Completed `batch_decompile_xref_sources` usage extraction**
  - Replaced placeholder "usage_line" with actual code line extraction
  - Returns usage_lines array showing how target address is referenced in decompiled code
  - Adds xref_addresses array showing specific instruction addresses
  - Affects: Java plugin batchDecompileXrefSources() method (lines 7362-7411)

**Quality Improvements:**
- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Improved `list_strings` filtering**
  - Added minimum length filter (4+ characters)
  - Added printable ratio requirement (80% printable ASCII)
  - Filters out single-byte hex strings like "\x83"
  - Returns meaningful message when no quality strings found
  - Affects: Java plugin listDefinedStrings() and new isQualityString() method (lines 3217-3272)

- Ã¢Å“â€¦ **Fixed `list_data_types` category filtering**
  - Previously only matched category paths (file names like "crtdefs.h")
  - Now also matches data type classifications (struct, enum, union, typedef, pointer, array)
  - Added new getDataTypeName() helper to determine type classification
  - Searching for "struct" now correctly returns Structure data types
  - Affects: Java plugin listDataTypes() and getDataTypeName() methods (lines 4683-4769)

### Testing
- Systematically tested all **53 read-only MCP tools** against D2Client.dll
- **100% success rate** across 6 categories:
  - Metadata & Connection (3 tools)
  - Listing (14 tools)
  - Get/Query (10 tools)
  - Analysis (12 tools)
  - Search (5 tools)
  - Advanced Analysis (9 tools)

### Impact
- More robust error handling with descriptive messages instead of silent failures
- Completion of previously stubbed implementations
- Better string detection quality (fewer false positives)
- Type-based data type filtering now works as expected
- All read-only tools verified functional and returning valid data

## v1.8.3 - 2025-10-26

### Removed Tools - API Cleanup
- Ã¢ÂÅ’ **Removed 3 redundant/non-functional MCP tools** (108 Ã¢â€ â€™ 105 tools)
  - `analyze_function_complexity` - Never implemented, returned placeholder JSON only
  - `analyze_data_types` - Superseded by comprehensive `analyze_data_region` tool
  - `auto_create_struct_from_memory` - Low-quality automated output, better workflow exists

### Rationale
- **analyze_function_complexity**: Marked "not yet implemented" for multiple versions, no demand
- **analyze_data_types**: Basic 18-line implementation completely replaced by `analyze_data_region` (200+ lines, comprehensive batch operation with xref mapping, boundary detection, stride analysis)
- **auto_create_struct_from_memory**: Naive field inference produced generic field_0, field_4 names without context; better workflow is `analyze_data_region` Ã¢â€ â€™ manual `create_struct` with meaningful names

### Impact
- Cleaner API surface with less confusion
- Removed dead code from both Python bridge and Java plugin
- No breaking changes for active users (tools were redundant or non-functional)
- Total MCP tools: **105 analysis + 6 script lifecycle = 111 tools**
